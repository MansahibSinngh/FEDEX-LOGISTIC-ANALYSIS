# **Project Summary**
This project delves into the global supply chain operations of FedEx Logistics, aiming to identify actionable insights that optimize shipment processes, reduce freight costs, and improve overall delivery efficiency. The dataset at the center of this analysis provides detailed information regarding purchase orders, shipment methods, vendor agreements (INCO terms), delivery schedules, and specific product attributes such as descriptions, weights, and quantities. By leveraging data analysis techniques, the project seeks to streamline supply chain operations, enabling informed decision-making that enhances cost-effectiveness and customer satisfaction.

***Business Objectives***


1.   Freight Cost Analysis:
  *   Evaluate freight costs across various shipment modes (e.g., air, sea) and destination countries to identify cost-saving opportunities.

2. Vendor Performance:
 * Analyze vendor contributions to shipment quantities, delivery timelines, and total line item values to assess performance and reliability.

3. Weight and Cost Relationships:

 * Examine the correlation between shipment weight, item quantities, and freight costs for better budgeting and forecasting.

4. Identifying Delays:

 * Investigate bottlenecks or delays in the supply chain by comparing scheduled delivery dates to actual delivery dates and uncover underlying causes.

5. Improving Shipment Methods:
 * Assess the impact of shipment modes and vendor agreements (INCO terms) on delivery performance and cost efficiency.

***Dataset Description***

The dataset captures comprehensive logistics data from FedEx, including:

* ID: Unique identifier for each logistics record.

* Shipment Mode: Transportation method (e.g., Air, Sea).

* Freight Cost (USD): Shipping cost for each line item.

* Vendor INCO Terms: Contractual terms defining vendor responsibilities (e.g., EXW, FCA).

* Delivery Dates: Scheduled and actual delivery dates to measure timeliness.

* Line Item Quantity: Total number of items in each shipment.

* Weight (Kilograms): Weight of the shipment.

* Country: Destination of the shipment.

* Vendor: Supplier or source of the shipment.

* Product Details: Detailed product attributes like description, dosage, and classification.

# **General Guidelines** : -  

1.   Well-structured, formatted, and commented code is required.
2.   Exception Handling, Production Grade Code & Deployment Ready Code will be a plus. Those students will be awarded some additional credits.
     
     The additional credits will have advantages over other students during Star Student selection.
       
             [ Note: - Deployment Ready Code is defined as, the whole .ipynb notebook should be executable in one go
                       without a single error logged. ]

3.   Each and every logic should have proper comments.
4. You may add as many number of charts you want. Make Sure for each and every chart the following format should be answered.
        

```
# Chart visualization code
```
            

*   Why did you pick the specific chart?
*   What is/are the insight(s) found from the chart?
* Will the gained insights help creating a positive business impact?
Are there any insights that lead to negative growth? Justify with specific reason.

5. You have to create at least 20 logical & meaningful charts having important insights.


[ Hints : - Do the Vizualization in  a structured way while following "UBM" Rule.

U - Univariate Analysis,

B - Bivariate Analysis (Numerical - Categorical, Numerical - Numerical, Categorical - Categorical)
