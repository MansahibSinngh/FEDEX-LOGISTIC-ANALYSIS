# **Project Summary**
This project delves into the global supply chain operations of FedEx Logistics, aiming to identify actionable insights that optimize shipment processes, reduce freight costs, and improve overall delivery efficiency. The dataset at the center of this analysis provides detailed information regarding purchase orders, shipment methods, vendor agreements (INCO terms), delivery schedules, and specific product attributes such as descriptions, weights, and quantities. By leveraging data analysis techniques, the project seeks to streamline supply chain operations, enabling informed decision-making that enhances cost-effectiveness and customer satisfaction.

***Business Objectives***


1.   Freight Cost Analysis:
  *   Evaluate freight costs across various shipment modes (e.g., air, sea) and destination countries to identify cost-saving opportunities.

2. Vendor Performance:
 * Analyze vendor contributions to shipment quantities, delivery timelines, and total line item values to assess performance and reliability.

3. Weight and Cost Relationships:

 * Examine the correlation between shipment weight, item quantities, and freight costs for better budgeting and forecasting.

4. Identifying Delays:

 * Investigate bottlenecks or delays in the supply chain by comparing scheduled delivery dates to actual delivery dates and uncover underlying causes.

5. Improving Shipment Methods:
 * Assess the impact of shipment modes and vendor agreements (INCO terms) on delivery performance and cost efficiency.
